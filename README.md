Task 1: Marks_Prediction_Using_Supervised_Learning Data Science and Business Analytics -1 (Predict the percentage of an student based on the no. of study hours)

Aim :Predict the percentage of students based on no. of study hours using Linear Regression and also predict the score if a student studies for 9.25 hours per day.

Linear Regression with Python Scikit Learn In this task we will see how the Python Scikit-Learn(sklearn) library for machine learning can be used to implement regressions. We will start with simple linear regression involving two variables.

Dataset The given dataset has two Columns, one contains no.of study hours and the other one contains the marks scored by him. The dataset can be found at http://bit.ly/w-data
